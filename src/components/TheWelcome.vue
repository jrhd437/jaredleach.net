  <h1>Origin Story</h1>
  <article class="post">
    <p>
      Jared didn't learn programming as a career choice.
      He was just an 8 year old kid who wanted to make something cool.
      By the time he was 13, he had learned XHMTL, CSS, and ActionScript (for Flash).
      Soon, he added JavaScript and, at age 15, had developed a website for his church.
    </p>
    <p>
      At 17, Jared began college, and soon earned an AAS in Web Development Technology
      from Rose State College in Midwest City, OK. While there, he learned PHP, MySQL,
      Object-Oriented Programming with Java, and a whole lot more -- like the Adobe
      Creative Suite, Cyber Security, and project management.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2015, Jared began working for Teton Solutions Group in Norman, OK.
      There, he worked with PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, KnockOutJs, Vue, Go, and other
      technologies. Among his projects, he converted a legacy VB6 application to a modern web application,
      and created an API that is used by one of the largest automotive data providers
      in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2021, Jared earned a BS from Liberty University. In 2022, he received
      CompTIA's Security+ certification, and left Teton Solutions Group to
      join Delaware Nation Industries as a .NET developer. As of 2023,
      Jared uses C# to develop and maintain WebForms, MVC, and WebAPI applications.
      He continues to use Vue to develop highly-responsive client-side applications, as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Jared isn't coding, he enjoys high-quality coffee and tea, reading from a wide
      variety of disciplines, and working toward a master's degree.
